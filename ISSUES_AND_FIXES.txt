Summary of findings, potential bugs, and concrete fixes (concise).

1) Tensor copying and autograd warnings
- Issue: torch.tensor(tensor) used for tensors from model/data causing aliasing/autograd warnings.
- Fix: use tensor.clone().detach() when storing static copies.

2) Unsafe matrix inverse / singularity checks
- Issue: torch.inverse and det-based checks on possibly singular/ill-conditioned matrices.
- Fix: use torch.linalg.cond, torch.linalg.slogdet or torch.linalg.pinv and torch.linalg.solve. Fall back to pinv when cond is large.

3) Eigenvalue/eigenvector checks on complex/Hermitian matrices
- Issue: numeric imaginary noise and inappropriate eigen routines.
- Fix: use torch.linalg.eigh for Hermitian when possible, scale tolerances by norm and dtype.

4) Fragile tests and fixed tolerances
- Issue: tests use absolute tolerances too strict and exact equality checks.
- Fix: centralize tolerances in tests/conftest.py, use pytest.approx or torch.allclose with rtol/atol based on dtype/device.

5) Metric computation correctness
- Issue: false negatives/positives counting may be wrong.
- Fix: compute tp/fp/fn with masks: tp = sum((pred==i) & (gt==i)), fp = sum((pred==i) & (gt!=i)), fn = sum((pred!=i) & (gt==i)). Guard divisions.

6) Replace torch.inverse in code/tests
- Recommendation: replace with solve/pinv and add conditioning checks. Emit warnings when cond > 1e8.

7) setup.py robustness
- Issue: reading files without encoding and fragile requirements parsing.
- Fix: use pathlib, read_text(encoding='utf-8'), filter commented lines in requirements.

8) .gitignore cleanup
- Issue: duplicate entries (e.g., .ropeproject, /site, mypy entries) and mixed patterns.
- Fix: remove duplicates, prefer canonical patterns (e.g., logs/ and not both logs and logs/*).

9) Notebook training loop issues
- Issue: scheduler.step() placement and potential divide-by-zero in printing metrics.
- Fix: call scheduler.step() according to scheduler type and guard prints when totals are zero.

Concrete code examples (apply where appropriate):

- Clone/detach
    sampling_matrix = sampling_matrix.clone().detach()

- Stable inverse/pinv
    if torch.isfinite(torch.linalg.cond(A)) and torch.linalg.cond(A) < 1e12:
        invA = torch.linalg.inv(A)
    else:
        invA = torch.linalg.pinv(A)

- Metric masks
    gt_mask = (targets == i)
    pred_mask = (preds == i)
    tp = (pred_mask & gt_mask).sum().item()
    fp = (pred_mask & ~gt_mask).sum().item()
    fn = (~pred_mask & gt_mask).sum().item()

Testing and CI recommendations
- Parametrize tests over dtype/device (cpu/cuda) with dtype-aware tolerances.
- Add numerical-stability unit tests that intentionally use ill-conditioned matrices and check fallback paths.
- Log warnings for high condition numbers rather than failing silently.

Next steps I can prepare:
- PR-style patches for sampling layer, tests/helpers.py, core graph validation, train_utils.py, setup.py, and .gitignore.
- Run tests and produce prioritized failure list.
